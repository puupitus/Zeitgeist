 france.100.t:0 "Welcome to Zeitgeist"
 france.100.d:0 "A ‘brief’ memo on what has been going on in the world recently and what's majorly different from our original timeline. In 1846, the Mexican-American war never happened, as Mexico submitted to American territorial demands. Then, in 1861, American Civil War started and, after been promised to regain its lost territories, Mexico joined CSA against USA - leading to rather decisive CSA victory. After the war, CSA never held the promise of giving territories to Mexico. In 1866 in Europe, Austria won the Austro-Prussian war with Italian help - leading to Austria vassalizing northern German states. What little was left of the USA, was devastated in 1898 in the Spanish-American War. The war had a huge downside for Spain though - while its whole armada and army were fighting the Americans in the Caribbean, an anarchist uprising happened in the Iberian peninsula. Both Portugal and Spain were lost to the anarchists, who have ruled the area since. Spanish Empire has settled in Venezuelan and Caribbean territory. Many Americans fled to the west coast and formed California Republic."

 france.101.t:0 "Welcome to Zeitgeist - Part Two"
 france.101.d:0 "Fast forwarding to 1914 - Austrian Empire attacked France through Belgium with Belgian help and the Great War started, Italy sided with France and Russia. UK, after weighing the options briefly, joined the Austrian side. Americans didn't join the war. The Franco-Italian alliance won the war and shattered Austrian Empire into pieces, Austria proper was divided between Switzerland and Hungary, the northern German states became independent - all with quite different politics. Southern states became independent small monarchies under the supervision of Italy. United Kingdom and all of its dominions were shattered as well. Only ‘country’ still loyal to England is the Hudson’s Bay Company operating in Canada. Australia and other former British territories in Asia  formed Australasian Confederation. India was divided into islamic Pakistan, republican Delhi region and socialist eastern Bengal. Belgian government was driven to Africa, ruling from their former colony of Congo. Ottoman Empire had sided with Austria as well, but Italy defeated them and conquered much of their land - giving them to the loyal ally of Byzantium."

 france.102.t:0 "Welcome to Zeitgeist - Part Three"
 france.102.d:0 "In Russia, a revolution started in 1917. There were many sides to this conflict, the czarists, bolsheviks, mensheviks, trudoviks and other smaller factions as well. The czarists lost the war, other factions fought against each other until they reached a stalemate and numerous smaller nations were born. The czar was exiled to Alaska, where the empire resided until buying the former British Columbia area from Hudson’s Bay Company. A great division happened within the bolshevik ranks, leading to Leon Trotsky fleeing to Brazil. There he has unified the country and some of its smaller neighbours into a socialist South American republic. The northeastern America, formerly known as New England, now New Prussia, had been draining its ethnic British people to the more prosperous CSA in the south and California in the west coast. After the Great War, a surge of German immigrants arrived in New England. Now the area is dominated by Germans, but about half of the people are Irish-Americans. PS. more details can be found online."
