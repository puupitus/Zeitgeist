 ZEITGEIST_DESC:0 "In 1936 the world is on the brink of yet another Great War. The winners of the previous war, France and Italy, are heads against each other, while the losers Austria, United Kingdom and Germany no longer even exist but were shattered to pieces of small nations by the victors. Meanwhile, increasingly more popular third position politics raise their heads and countries are joining the gloomy shadow over the whole world, the Zeitgeist Pact."
